# UndericeBGC
This repository is intended to host data and scripts while we work on analyses related to under ice biogeochemistry (a more-indepth look of data included in the under ice synthesis manuscript).

Data was retrieved from the [North Temperate Lakes - Long Term Ecology Research](https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/datacatalog/search) group. Data will stored here on github only for the duration of analyses, not long-term. For more information about the data used here, visit the NTL-LTER site.
